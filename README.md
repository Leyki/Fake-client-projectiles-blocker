### Fake client projectiles blocker

Rewritten by [Kasea](https://github.com/Kaseaa) to work with multiple projectiles skills since it wasn't working before, please redownload if you have an old release!

This module will basically stop the client from sending invalid projectile packets sent in reaction to other players projectiles being received to avoid consuming completely unnecesary net bandwidth.
